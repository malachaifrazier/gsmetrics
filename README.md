GSMetrics is a simple Gem to help you with pushing data into Google Spreadsheets.

You can install it by calling

```gem install gsmetrics```

Development was started so we could run a cron job in regular intervals and push metrics data about Railsonfire to a Google Spreadsheet.

To start using it simply run

``` gsmetrics ```

and follow the instructions given. You will have to create a new google API Project and after
finishing all steps get code you can simply paste into your codebase.

## Usage

Create a new GSMetrics Session and a worksheet, then append to it and save the row:

```ruby
session = GSMetrics::Session.new(client_id, client_secret, refresh_token)
worksheet = session.worksheet document_id, worksheet_id
worksheet << 1
worksheet.append(5)
worksheet.save_row
```

After saving a row all appended data is removed and you can start with a new row. 
Please make sure there are only empty lines at the end of the spreadsheet as the first empty line is used to write the data.


### Worksheet ID

You can find out what your worksheet_id is by going to

https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/#{your_document_id}/private/full

For every worksheet there will be an <entry> element which has an id. The last part of the id (something like od6) is the worksheet_id you have to provide.
If you find a better way to get that information or would implement an extension to the executable to go over the api and get that information you are very welcome.
